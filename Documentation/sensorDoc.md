- Lambda - an event-driven serverless computing platform
- S3 - Simple Storage Service

## Lambda definition

Lambda > create functions

lambdaSaveSensorData > convert to .parquet file and safe the Sensor Data in S3 Bucket

# Architecture



# Dataflow

- Devises to AWS - the data runs from the sensor to AWS IoT Core - serves to connect the devices and the AWS services
- MQTT test client - to monitor the connection to AWS
- Lambda function - converts the data to .parquet format and passes it to the S3 bucket for storage
- S3 Bucket - for storing the received sensor data
